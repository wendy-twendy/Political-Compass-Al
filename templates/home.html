                The Political Compass Quiz is designed to help you understand your political beliefs
                by placing you on a two-dimensional grid. This grid represents economic views (left to right)
                and social views (libertarian to authoritarian).
            </p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                Answer 20 questions about various political issues, and we'll plot your position
                on the political compass. This can help you better understand your own political leanings
                and how they compare to different political ideologies.
